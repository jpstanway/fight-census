## What Fight Census is all about
Most MMA stats revolve around *in fight* statistics - how many punches were thrown or landed, how many takedowns each fighter gets, etc.

Fight Census seeks to compile data on a much broader scope however, taking into account the fighter base itself. For example, what is the average age, or size advantage of most winning fighters?

This 'census' is compiled on an annual basis, and seeks to help those understand certain trends that may not be so obvious, as well as help those in making betting decisions.

## Disclaimer
Fight Census is new and not perfect. Most of the data is gathered automatically via web scraper, while some is manually added into the database.

Also, currently the census only covers the UFC fighter base, but will be extended to include other organizations such as Bellator in the future.
